                    <p className='about-me'> Hello! I'm Sam, a fullstack web developer, customer service professional, and skilled laborer. For the past 10 years I have spent my time mostly in the agricultural, landscaping, and service industries, including personally planning and successfully operating a profitable agricultural business venture. Looking for a permanent career change and to learn something new, in 2022 I attended the University of Wisconsin'sâ€™ Web Development bootcamp and earned a certificate in full stack web development in November of that year. During the course of the bootcamp I developed new skills in many technologies including JavaScript ES6+, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, NoSQL, Node, the MERN stack, responsive web design, and also honed in my business computer skills. I became proficient in Google Workspace, Zoom, Slack, typing, Microsoft Office, and have gotten some exposure to data entry. I am currently using my business, web development, and customer service skills running my own business as a landscaper and freelance web developer while I search for a permanent role in web design and development. I am also taking classes through the Zero To Mastery digital coding academy where I am teaching myself Vue, mastering Microsoft Office, and expanding my web development abilities. I am excited to learn as many new technologies and skills as I can! I love solving puzzles, being creative, and learning new things. Everything I work on I take as an opportunity to learn something new. I am looking forward to starting my career in web design and development in the coming year! Nice to meet you.
