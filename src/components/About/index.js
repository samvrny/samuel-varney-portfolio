                    <p className='about-me'> Hello! My name is Samuel Varney, and I am a fullstack web developer with an emphasis on front-end development.
                        For the past 10 years I have worked across a few different industries and through a little trial and error, am happy to have chosen web
                        development as a permanent career path because it aligns with my passions and future goals. In November of 2022 I graduated from the
                        University of Wisconsinsâ€™ Web Development bootcamp that focuses on Javascript and the MERN stack, and earned a certificate in full stack
                        web development from the UW. During the course of the bootcamp I developed new skills in many technologies including JavaScript ES6+,
                        HTML, CSS, React, SQL, NoSQL, Node, the MERN stack, and responsive web design. I love solving puzzles, being creative, and learning new
                        things. I am known as a hard worker with a strong work ethic, and I enjoy picking up new coding skills and applying to develop and debug
                        web applications. Each project I work on I take as an opportunity not only to learn something new, but design apps that are interesting,
                        user friendly and have an impactful user experience. I am very excited to leverage my skills as part of a quality-driven team to build better
                        experiences on the web!
